# **Chat-Message** Project.
 
This project was done in the NWL-5 event, where I could improve my skills using TypeScript, Node and Websocket.

Here is developed a chat system where an user sends a message and than a admin or helper can chat with the user to help him with his issue.
 
**A glimpse**
 
 * The user adds an email and a message.
